I am not quite sure yet what my topic will be about. Initially i wanted to write about the evolution of the critique on AI. Why would i stop that, there s no real reaseon for it now is there? I should probably read some more before i go further in to this topic, thouuuugh there is another nice paper online that deals with a similar situation.
